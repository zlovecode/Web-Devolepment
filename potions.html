      <h1>10. Draught of Peace</h1>
      <p>
        ingredients: Powdered moonstone, unicorn horn, and porcupine quills
        Effect: Relieves anxiety and agitation Administered to several
        fifth-year students following their panic attacks regarding upcoming
        O.W.L. exams, the Draught of Peace calms nerves and allows
        concentration. It might not eliminate enemies or give an edge in battle,
        but the Draught of Peace combats our unseen struggles against depression
        and anxiety, something that would aid a great number of people in real
        life. Despite its soothing effects, the Draught of Peace is ironically
        tricky to craft, and Professor Snape once gave Harry a score of zero in
        his attempt to brew one due to a simple mistake.

      <h1>9. Amortentia</h1>
      <p>
        Ingredients: Unknown Effect: Induces an intense artificial love
        Advertised as the strongest love potion in existence, Amortentia can't
        create true love, but it causes such powerful infatuation bordering on
        obsession that it's hard to tell the difference. The process for mixing
        it has yet to be revealed, but we know that the potion's aroma changes
        to match scents that every individual finds pleasant; to Hermione, it
        smells like fresh-cut grass and new parchment. A dangerous drug,
        Amortentia is the closest thing we've seen to date rape in Harry Potter;
        Merope Gaunt (Voldermort's mother) used it to force Tom Riddle Senior to
        marry her and conceive a child, and Romilda Vane slipped some into
        chocolates intended for Harry that Ron ended up eating instead.
